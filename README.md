# DVDLibrary
Replicates a DVD library

This project, although simple in functionality, implements a full MVC approach hence easily allows for infinetly scalable complexity.

Key ideas:

Dependency injection,
Unit tests,
Reading and writing data to a file where necessary, including an audit file,
Creation of project specific exceptions,
Functionality being handled in the service layer.
